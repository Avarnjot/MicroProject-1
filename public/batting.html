    <p>A batsman from the batting team faces deliveries from the bowler of the opposing team. The batsman's primary goal is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. Batsmen also try to protect their wickets from being knocked over by the bowler, as this results in them being "out."</p>
