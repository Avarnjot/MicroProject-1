      Cricket is a popular sport played in many countries around the world, particularly in countries like England, Australia, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main objective of the game is for one team to score more runs than the opposing team. Runs are scored by the batting team when their batsmen hit the ball and successfully run between two sets of wickets.

      Test Cricket: Test cricket is the longest format of the game and is considered the pinnacle of cricket. Matches can last up to five days, with each team having two innings to bat and bowl.
      One Day Internationals (ODIs): In ODIs, each team typically gets one innings, and the match is limited to a maximum of 50 overs per side. ODIs are known for their fast-paced action and are played over a single day.
      Twenty20 (T20) Cricket: T20 cricket is the shortest format, with each team facing a maximum of 20 overs. Matches are usually completed within a few hours, making it a popular choice for spectators and broadcasters.    </p>
